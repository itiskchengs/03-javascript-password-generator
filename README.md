# 03-javascript-password-generator

In this project I used the code that was given in this homework assignment for this week and built a password generator. I wrote all of the password logic when you click the button to run the generate password function. Once you go through the selections of what criteria you want in your password. Then it will display back the password on the screen to you with the criterias that you have given it. 

- Created the function and logic to generate the password. 

- Created the prompt and confrims to gather the criterias needed to generate what the user wants. 

- Created a random generator function that will give back a random character in the array its called for. 

- Created if / else if and else statments to do certain things depending on the users choices. 

- Leveraged multiple array methods while working with building the logic.
